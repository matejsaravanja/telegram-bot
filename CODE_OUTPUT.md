# Bot Response System

A neutral and helpful bot that acknowledges user input and invites further interaction.

## Features
1. **Neutral Responses**: Predefined list of open-ended responses.
2. **Keyword Detection**: Detects specific keywords like "bot", "hi", "hello", etc.
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Handles ambiguous or unsupported inputs gracefully.
4. **Dynamic Responses**: Allows adding new responses or updating the fallback message.
5. **Logging**: Logs all interactions to `logs/bot_logs.log`.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bot_response_system
   ```
3. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
4. Interact with the bot in the terminal. Type "exit" to end the conversation.

## Example
```
Bot: Hi! I'm your assistant. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.
You: Hello bot
Bot: Greetings! Feel free to ask me anything.
You: What’s the weather today?
Bot: I’m sorry, I didn’t quite understand that. Could you please rephrase or provide more details?
You: Exit
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day.
```

## Customization
- Add new responses using the `add_response` method.
- Update the fallback response using the `update_fallback_response` method.
```

### **How to Run the Application**
1. **Clone or create the directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir bot_response_system
   cd bot_response_system
   ```
2. **Create the files**:
   - Save the `bot.py` code in a file named `bot.py`.
   - Save the `requirements.txt` content in a file named `requirements.txt`.
   - Save the `README.md` content in a file named `README.md`.
3. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
4. **Interact with the bot** in the terminal. Type "exit" to end the conversation.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Dynamic Responses**: Add new responses or update the fallback message during runtime.
2. **Logging**: All interactions are logged to `logs/bot_logs.log` for debugging and monitoring.
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Handles unexpected errors gracefully without crashing.
4. **Easy to Extend**: Ready for integration with NLP libraries, external APIs, or deployment to platforms like Slack or Discord.

This implementation is user-friendly, maintainable, and ready for production use!
